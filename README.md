## About
FUSage is a mobile app coded in Dart using Flutter Framework. I made that app, because I wanted to write my fuel statistics every tank.

As you can see, there is a Windows folder when it is a mobile app. That because I used Windows for most tests. So I can say that the app is working on Windows and mobile devices.
